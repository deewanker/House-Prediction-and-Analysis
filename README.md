# House-Prediction-and-Analysis

Executive Summary:

The real estate industry is dynamic, influenced by various factors that impact house prices. As part of our analysis, we conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into the dynamics of house valuation. By examining a dataset containing diverse parameters such as location, size, amenities, and historical transaction data, we aimed to identify key variables that significantly influence house prices and provide actionable recommendations for strategic decision-making.

Introduction:
The objective of this analysis is to understand the complex dynamics of residential real estate pricing through EDA. By leveraging advanced data analytics techniques and visualization tools, our goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends within the dataset. This analysis will empower real estate companies to make informed decisions and strategically position properties for better business opportunities.

Data Acquisition and Cleaning:
Imported necessary libraries and loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and dropped unnecessary columns to ensure data quality.

Univariate Analysis:
Explored individual variables to understand their distributions and characteristics.
Visualized house prices and Price Per SqFt using histograms and density plots.

Multivariate Analysis:
Investigated relationships between multiple variables impacting house prices.
Utilized correlation matrices and scatterplots to uncover dependencies and correlations between features.

Feature Engineering:
Created new features to enhance the predictive ability of the model.
Introduced Price Per SqFt and Years Since Built to provide standardized metrics and age-related valuation.

Size Impact Analysis:
Understood how size-related features affect house prices.
Analyzed scatterplots to identify trends and patterns illustrating the relationship between size and house prices.

Historical Pricing Trends:
Examined historical pricing trends over time.
Conducted time-series analysis to identify market behavior, trends, and cyclical fluctuations.

Customer Preferences and Amenities:
Investigated the impact of customer preferences and amenities on house prices.
Analyzed boxplots to understand the influence of amenities such as pools, garages, and outdoor spaces on house prices.

Conclusion:
The EDA provided valuable insights into the dynamics of house valuation in the real estate market. Key findings include the importance of size-related features, historical pricing trends, and the impact of amenities on house prices. These insights can guide strategic decision-making, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance competitive positioning in the market.
